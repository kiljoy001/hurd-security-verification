GNU Hurd Secure Traversal Test Suite
Verifying implementation against formal Coq proofs
=====================================

=== Testing bounded_traversal property ===
PASS: Node initialization with valid max_depth
PASS: bounded_traversal property holds for valid node
PASS: Node initialization fails with max_depth = 0
PASS: bounded_traversal property fails for NULL node

=== Testing bounded_resource_consumption property ===
PASS: Node initialization succeeds
PASS: bounded_resource_consumption property holds initially
PASS: bounded_resource_consumption property fails when memory exceeded
PASS: bounded_resource_consumption property fails when operations exceeded
PASS: bounded_resource_consumption property holds with valid bounds

=== Testing malicious_fs_dos_prevention theorem ===
PASS: Node initialization succeeds
PASS: DOS prevention succeeds for valid depth
PASS: DOS prevention fails for excessive depth
PASS: DOS prevention fails when resource bounds violated

=== Testing secure traversal operations ===
PASS: Node1 initialization succeeds
PASS: Node2 initialization succeeds
PASS: Traversal context initialization succeeds
FAIL: Valid traversal check succeeds
PASS: Traversal depth correctly incremented
FAIL: Traversal completion succeeds
PASS: Node depth correctly updated

=== Testing resource bounds checking ===
PASS: Resource bounds creation succeeds
PASS: Resource check succeeds within limits
PASS: Resource check fails for memory limit violation
PASS: Resource check fails for operation limit violation
PASS: Resource check fails for time limit violation

=== Testing edge cases ===
PASS: Node init fails with NULL node
PASS: Property verification fails with NULL node
PASS: Resource check succeeds with NULL bounds (no limits)
PASS: Node init fails with max_depth = 0
PASS: Traversal begin fails with max_depth = 0
